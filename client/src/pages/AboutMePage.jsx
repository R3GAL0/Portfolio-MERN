            <p>
            I have completed a Bsc in Physics and am currently completing an Msc in Physics part time. I have a history of coding that started with my Bsc where I took an intoductory course to Java and did quite well in it. However at the time I did not see it as a career path as I wanted to get into something physics related. But my coding journey did not stop there,physics is a field that deals closely with coding after all. I have since used coding as part of my Bsc thesis, and during my Msc. Using languages such as Mathematica, Perl, and Python for various purposes but until recently I still did not see myself as much of a developer even though I enjoyed coding.

            My opinion on my career path has shifted over time and I became less interested in Academia, however just about all the jobs related to physics deal with academia so I have decided to pursue a career in coding, or more specifically web development. To achieve this I have taken a full stack web development boot camp with the University of Toronto. It was a rough road but I have made it through and learned much because of it. Now I can claim that I am a full stack developer. However I know that the journey does not end there and even after the bootcamp has ended I have continued to sharpen my coding skills through additional projects as can be seen on my github (linked in the footer) or through additional courses such as one for Amazon Web Services.
