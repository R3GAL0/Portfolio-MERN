## Description

A website to serve as my portfolio. It shows a number of the projects I have made, either by myself or as part of a team. There are separate pages for an about me, contact, and resume. My resume is downloadable from the site. However the contact me doesn't work at the moment as I search for an smtp server.


TBD:
 - styling
 - redeploy defunct projects
 - add smtp server
